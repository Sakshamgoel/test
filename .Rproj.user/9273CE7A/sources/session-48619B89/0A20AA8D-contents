## Problem 2: COVID-19

#### The “covid.csv” file contains data on Covid-19 cases in a province of Italy. For the following exercises, only provide first rows or elements in the output if the results are too large.

```{r}
covid <- read.csv("~/Desktop/R Class/GitHub/HW3_Group4/covid.csv", row.names = 1)
```

#### Order the data based on the date of diagnosis (from first to most recent).

```{r}
covid[, c(1,4,6,7)] <- lapply(covid[, c(1,4,6,7)], as.Date)

covid <- covid[order(covid$Date.of.diagnosis),]
```

#### Add a column that reports if a case was symptomatic AND in non-intensive care. Name the observation “symptom_nonintense” if the conditions apply and “other” if not and then produce a bar plot of this new variable.

```{r}
covid$Symptom.care <- NA
covid$Symptom.care <- ifelse(covid$Symptoms == "Symptomatic" & covid$Hospitalization.type == "Non-Intensive care hospitalization", "symptom_nonintense","other")
barplot(table(covid$Symptom.care))
```

#### Count the number of cases that are asymptomatic OR in non-intensive care (but not both) AND were born after 1990.

```{r}
sum(xor(covid$Symptoms == "Asymptomatic", covid$Hospitalization.type == "Non-Intensive care hospitalization") & covid$Date.of.birth > "1990-12-31")
```

#### Create a new dataset including only the rows where “Epidemiological.link…Notes” includes the words “contact” OR “symptom” (or both). Hint: you can use the grep() function and tolower().

```{r}
covid$Epidemiological.link...Notes <- tolower(covid$Epidemiological.link...Notes)

filter.notes <- grep("contact | symptom", covid$Epidemiological.link...Notes)

new.covid <- covid[filter.notes,]

```

#### In the previous dataset add a column reporting the age (in years, therefore in integer format) of each patient as of October 25, 2022. Save this dataset into a .csv file and make it available on your GitHub repository for this assignment.

```{r}
Age <- c(with(new.covid, floor((as.Date("2022-10-25", format = "%Y-%m-%d") - new.covid$Date.of.birth) / 365)))

new.covid <- cbind(new.covid, Age)

write.csv(new.covid, "problem2_result.csv")

```
